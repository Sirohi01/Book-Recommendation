I recommend creating a book recommendation system project using Python and various machine learning libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Dataset Selection:
Utilize datasets available on platforms like Kaggle, containing information about books, users, and ratings.
Data Preprocessing:

Use Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Employ Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize book ratings, and understand user behavior.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features and create user-item interaction matrices.
Model Development:

Apply scikit-learn (sklearn) to implement collaborative filtering algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for user-based or item-based recommendations.
Evaluation Metrics:

Utilize appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance.
Interactive Visualization:

Enhance user experience by integrating interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Deployment:
Consider deploying the recommendation system using platforms like Flask or integrating it into a web application.
